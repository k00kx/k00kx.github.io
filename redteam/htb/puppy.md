### üß© Enumeration and Initial Access

<p class="indent-paragraph">
The enumeration phase began with a<code>SYN</code> scan targeting all TCP ports, bypassing ICMP probes and optimizing execution speed. This approach revealed a wide range of open ports commonly associated with Active Directory infrastructures, such as<code>DNS</code> (53),<code>Kerberos</code> (88),<code>NetBIOS</code> (139),<code>SMB</code> (445),<code>LDAP</code>/<code>LDAPS</code> (389/636),<code>kpasswd5</code> (464), and<code>Global Catalog</code> (3268/3269). The presence of<code>NFS</code> (2049),<code>iSCSI</code> (3260),<code>WinRM</code> (5985), and additional high ports further reinforced the assumption of a Windows-based domain controller. These findings set the stage for deeper reconnaissance into available services, domain exposure, and eventual attack surface mapping.

<p class="indent-paragraph">
All signs were screaming ‚Äúdomain controller.‚Äù So we tossed the creds into SMB to see what would bite. Using<code>crackmapexec</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we authenticated to the SMB service with the provided credentials. The response confirmed our theory, this machine is indeed a domain controller named <code>DC</code><span class="codefix">,</span> part of the <span class="blue">PUPPY.HTB</span> domain. 
</p>

```
~$ crackmapexec smb <IP> -u levi.james -p 'KingofAkron2025!'

SMB         <IP>     445    DC               [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC) (domain:PUPPY.HTB) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         <IP>     445    DC               [+] PUPPY.HTB\levi.james:KingofAkron2025! 
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
Since we now know the domain is <span class="blue">PUPPY.HTB</span> and the hostname of the controller is simply<code>DC</code><span class="codefix">,</span> it‚Äôs a safe bet that<code>dc.puppy.htb</code> will resolve internally. Adding this entry to our local resolver will allow us to refer to the domain controller by name instead of IP, which comes in handy when dealing with SMB, Kerberos, and other AD protocols. 
</p>


```
~$ nano /etc/hosts

<IP>   dc.puppy.htb
```

### üìÇ Enumerating SMB Shares

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With the hostname now resolvable, we proceeded to enumerate SMB shares using valid credentials. The scan confirmed the host as a Windows Server 2022 domain controller in the <span class="blue">PUPPY.HTB</span> realm. Alongside standard shares like <code>ADMIN$</code><span class="codefix">,</span> <code>C$</code><span class="codefix">,</span> and <code>IPC$</code><span class="codefix">,</span> one stood out:<span><code>DEV</code></code><span class="codefix">,</span> a custom entry labeled as a development resource for ‚ÄúPUPPY-DEVS‚Äù. Interestingly, no permissions were listed for the DEV share, suggesting either a misconfiguration or that <code>levi.james</code> wasn't part of the appropriate group.
</p>



```
~$ crackmapexec smb dc.puppy.htb -u levi.james -p 'KingofAkron2025!' --shares

```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
The next step was to enumerate domain users via RID brute-forcing. <code>nxc</code> (NetExec), a modern and modular successor to CrackMapExec, proved ideal for the task. By leveraging the <code>--rid-brute</code> option, we prompted the domain controller to reveal internal identifiers tied to user accounts. RIDs (Relative Identifiers) are how Active Directory distinguishes users and groups under the hood. Even with low privileges, a properly filtered enumeration can reveal a surprising amount of structure within the environment.
</p>

```
~$ nxc smb dc.puppy.htb -u 'levi.james' -p 'KingofAkron2025!' --rid-brute | grep "SidTypeUser" | awk -F '\\\\' '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'

Administrator
Guest
krbtgt
DC$
levi.james
ant.edwards
adam.silver
jamie.williams
steph.cooper
steph.cooper_adm
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With a list of users gathered, the next logical step was to investigate group memberships. Using <code>ldapdomaindump</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we obtained a complete snapshot of the domain including users, groups, and their relationships. The resulting dump provided a clear overview of the environment‚Äôs structure and helped identify privileged accounts worth pursuing.
</p>


```
~$ ldapdomaindump dc.puppy.htb -u 'PUPPY.HTB\levi.james' -p 'KingofAkron2025!' 

[*] Connecting to host...
[*] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[*] Starting domain dump
[+] Domain dump finished
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
After running<code>ldapdomaindump</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we inspected the generated<code>domain_users.html</code> report to get a better view of the domain landscape. Beyond the usual suspects like<code>Administrator</code><span class="codefix">,</span><code>Guest</code><span class="codefix">,</span> and<code>krbtgt</code><span class="codefix">,</span> several user accounts stood out ‚Äî notably<code>jamie.williams</code><span class="codefix">,</span><code>adam.silver</code><span class="codefix">,</span> and<code>ant.edwards</code><span class="codefix">,</span> all members of the <span class="blue">DEVELOPERS</span> group. Meanwhile,<code>levi.james</code><span class="codefix">,</span> our current session, is sitting comfortably in <span class="blue">HR</span>. Not quite the crew you'd expect to be pushing code ‚Äî but maybe that can change.

### üßæ BloodHound ACL Analysis

<p class="indent-paragraph">
After mapping out the domain users and their respective groups, the next logical step was to understand the relationships between them. BloodHound is a powerful tool for visualizing Active Directory trust paths and permission structures ‚Äî and we didn‚Äôt want to miss any low-hanging escalation routes. Using the same credentials, we launched<code>bloodhound-python</code> to dump the AD metadata.
</p>


```
~$ bloodhound-python -u 'levi.james' -p 'KingofAkron2025!' -dc dc.puppy.htb -d PUPPY.HTB -c All -ns <IP>

<p class="indent-paragraph">
To gain visibility into how our current user fits into the Active Directory environment, we leveraged<code>BloodHound</code> with the previously dumped data. After importing all JSON files, we ran a simple query to map direct relationships:<code>MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m</code><span class="codefix">.</span> This allowed us to graph the domain layout. From there, we right-clicked the<code>levi.james@PUPPY.HTB</code> node and selected <em>Shortest Paths to Here</em>, revealing a cleaner, contextual view of privileges, group memberships, and potential lateral opportunities.
</p>

<p class="indent-paragraph">
  <img src="/img/redteam/htb/puppy/graph_levi_puppy_htb.png" alt="BloodHound graph for levi.james" style="width:100%; border-radius:6px; margin-top: 1em;" />
</p>

<p class="indent-paragraph">
As seen earlier in the user dump, <span class="blue">levi.james</span> is part of the <span class="blue">HR</span> group which neatly explains why access to the <span class="blue">DEV</span> share didn‚Äôt go through. It‚Äôs not about broken permissions; Levi just wasn‚Äôt on the guest list. But instead of giving up, we turned to BloodHound to see if there was another way in. Using the query<code>MATCH (n:Group {name: 'DEVELOPERS@PUPPY.HTB'}) RETURN n</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we locked onto the target group and followed <em>‚ÄúShortest Paths to Here‚Äù</em>. The results were promising: our session,<code>levi.james@puppy.htb</code><span class="codefix">,</span> has a <span class="highlight-red">GenericWrite</span> edge on the <span class="blue">DEVELOPERS</span> group, a delegated permission that allows modification of group attributes. In short, Levi‚Äôs not a dev yet, but he has just enough power to make himself one.
</p>

<img src="/img/redteam/htb/puppy/graph_dev_puppy_htb.png" class="full-width-img" alt="BloodHound GenericWrite to Developers group"/>

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With <span class="blue">levi.james</span> holding <span class="highlight-red">GenericWrite</span> over the <span class="blue">DEVELOPERS</span> group, the next step was to retrieve his full Distinguished Name (DN), required for direct LDAP modifications. Using <code>ldapsearch</code> with appropriate filters, we extracted only the necessary DN value: <code>CN=Levi B. James,OU=MANPOWER,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB</code><span class="codefix">.</span> This identifier would later be used to update group memberships.
</p>


```
~$ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc.puppy.htb -D "levi.james@puppy.htb" -w 'KingofAkron2025!' -b "DC=puppy,DC=htb" "(sAMAccountName=levi.james)" dn | grep "^dn:"
                  
dn: CN=Levi B. James,OU=MANPOWER,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With Levi‚Äôs distinguished name in hand, we prepare an LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) file ‚Äî a simple, structured format used to define changes to directory entries. In this case, the file contains four essential lines: the first line,<code>dn: CN=DEVELOPERS,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB</code><span class="codefix">,</span> specifies the exact object we intend to modify (the DEVELOPERS group); the second line,<code>changetype: modify</code><span class="codefix">,</span> tells the LDAP server this is a modification operation; the third line,<code>add: member</code><span class="codefix">,</span> defines the attribute we are appending to; and the final line,<code>member: CN=Levi B. James,OU=MANPOWER,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB</code><span class="codefix">,</span> inserts Levi‚Äôs DN as a new group member. This small file effectively instructs the domain controller to enroll Levi into the DEVELOPERS group ‚Äî and with the proper permissions in place, it‚Äôs all done in a single silent move.
</p>

```
~$ nano modify-developers-group.ldif

dn: CN=DEVELOPERS,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB
changetype: modify
add: member
member: CN=Levi B. James,OU=MANPOWER,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With the LDIF file prepared and saved as <code>modify-developers-group.ldif</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we proceeded to apply the modification using <code>ldapmodify</code><span class="codefix">.</span> The command authenticated as <span class="blue">levi.james</span> and instructed the domain controller to append his distinguished name to the <code>DEVELOPERS</code> group. Once executed, the server processed the request and, assuming no ACLs interfered, confirmed success ‚Äî Levi was now officially part of the developers.
</p>


```
~$ ldapmodify -x -H ldap://dc.puppy.htb -D "levi.james@puppy.htb" -w 'KingofAkron2025!' -f modify-developers-group.ldif

modifying entry "CN=DEVELOPERS,DC=PUPPY,DC=HTB"
```

### üîì Exploring the DEV Share

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With Levi‚Äôs distinguished name successfully injected into the <code>DEVELOPERS</code> group, all that remained was to verify whether the new privileges had taken effect. Using <code>netexec</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we confirmed that Levi now had <code>READ</code> access to the <code>DEV</code> share. The silent LDAP modification had done its job: Levi wasn‚Äôt just listed in the directory anymore; he had joined the developers' workspace.
</p>

```
~$ nxc smb dc.puppy.htb -u levi.james -p 'KingofAkron2025!' --shares

```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
Now that <span class="blue">levi.james</span> is part of the <code>DEVELOPERS</code> group, it‚Äôs time to validate access. Connecting to the <code>DEV</code> share via <code>smbclient</code> confirms that permissions have been updated. Within the directory, several notable files emerge, including a KeePass installer and a suspiciously named <code>recovery.kdbx</code> database.
</p>

```

### üîê Cracking the KeePass Vault

<p class="indent-paragraph">
Once <code>recovery.kdbx</code> was secured, the next logical step was attempting decryption. Using <code>keepassxc-cli</code> revealed that the database was protected by a master password. All initial guesses failed, each attempt resulted in an <code>Invalid credentials</code> error, confirming that the correct key had to be uncovered through other means.
</p>


```
~$ keepassxc-cli open recovery.kdbx

Enter password to unlock recovery.kdbx: ********
Error while reading the database: Invalid credentials were provided, please try again.
If this reoccurs, then your database file may be corrupt. (HMAC mismatch)
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
Faced with a modern KeePass database unsupported by traditional tools like <code>keepass2john</code><span class="codefix">,</span> an alternative was needed. The Python-based tool <a href="https://github.com/r3nt0n/keepass4brute" target="_blank"><code>keepass4brute</code></a> proved effective for this scenario. A dictionary attack using the classic <code>rockyou.txt</code> wordlist was launched, and although the process was slow, success eventually came with the word <code>liverpool</code>, the correct password to unlock the secrets stored within <code>recovery.kdbx</code><span class="codefix">.</span>
</p>


```
~$ ./keepass4brute.sh recovery.kdbx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

keepass4brute 1.3 by r3nt0n
https://github.com/r3nt0n/keepass4brute

[+] Words tested: 36/14344392 - Attempts per minute: 216 - Estimated time remaining: 6 weeks, 4 days
[+] Current attempt: liverpool

[*] Password found: liverpool
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
The CLI hit a wall, but the GUI picked up where it left off. With the recovered <code>liverpool</code> password, we launched <code>recovery.kdbx</code> and finally gained visual access to the database. Inside, we found five familiar names tied to domain accounts, each entry hiding a potential credential behind masked fields. With a few clicks, the passwords were revealed: <code>HJKL2025!</code><span class="codefix">,</span> <code>Antman2025!</code><span class="codefix">,</span> <code>JamieLove2025!</code><span class="codefix">,</span> <code>ILY2025!</code><span class="codefix">,</span> and <code>Steve2025!</code><span class="codefix">.</span> 
</p>

<img src="/img/redteam/htb/puppy/keepass_recovery-kdbx.png" class="full-width-img" alt="recovery.kdbx"/>

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With a fresh batch of credentials in hand (usernames from our earlier RID brute-force and passwords extracted from the cracked KeePass database) it was time to test for valid logins. Feeding both lists into <code>netexec</code> allowed us to iterate through potential combinations efficiently. The result? A clean hit: <span class="blue">PUPPY.HTB\ant.edwards:Antman2025!</span>. No domain admin logins, yet, but this set was definitely worth validating across the environment.
</p>


```
~$ nxc smb dc.puppy.htb -u users-puppy-htb.txt -p pass-puppy-htb.txt | grep "[+]"

```

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è BloodHound Enumeration & AD Mapping

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With valid domain credentials for <code>ant.edwards</code> in hand, we reran BloodHound to assess the privileges associated with this new user. A full collection cycle targeting the domain controller was initiated, and the process completed successfully. Just like that, the map of Active Directory got a lot more interesting.
</p>

While reviewing the permissions extracted via BloodHound, one edge stood out: <span class="highlight-red">GenericAll</span> granted to <span class="blue">ant.edwards</span> over<code>adam.silver</code><span class="codefix">.</span> This level of access permits full control over the target user object, including the ability to set a new password. Following the approach described in <a href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/forcechangepassword-active-directory-abuse/" target="_blank" style="color: #89CFF0; text-decoration: none;"><strong>Abusing AD-DACL: ForceChangePassword</strong></a>, we connected to the domain controller using<code>rpcclient</code><span class="codefix">,</span> a powerful command-line tool for interacting with Windows services over SMB. By issuing<code>setuserinfo ADAM.SILVER 23 Ch4ng3Passw0rd@123</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we invoked the level<code>23</code> structure, which instructs the server to silently overwrite the user‚Äôs password without requiring the original. At first, login attempts failed with<code>STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED</code><span class="codefix">.</span>
</p>


```
~$ rpcclient -U 'dc.puppy.htb\Ant.Edwards%Antman2025!' dc.puppy.htb

rpcclient $> setuserinfo ADAM.SILVER 23 Ch4ng3Passw0rd@123
rpcclient $> exit
```

```
~$ nxc smb dc.puppy.htb  -u 'ADAM.SILVER' -p 'Ch4ng3Passw0rd@123'

SMB         dc.puppy.htb     445    DC               [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:DC) (domain:PUPPY.HTB) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

```

### üîì Account Reactivation and Shell Access via Evil-WinRM

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With Adam‚Äôs password reset, we were nearly there, except the account was still flagged as disabled. To address this, we used<code>bloodyAD</code><span class="codefix">,</span> a post-exploitation tool designed to manipulate Active Directory objects via LDAP operations. By issuing<code>remove uac 'ADAM.SILVER' -f ACCOUNTDISABLE</code><span class="codefix">,</span> we cleared the<code>ACCOUNTDISABLE</code> bit from the<code>userAccountControl</code> attribute, effectively reactivating the account. No need to edit the object manually or interact via GUI, a single command, and Adam Silver was back online.
</p>


```
~$ bloodyAD --host dc.puppy.htb -d puppy.htb -u ant.edwards -p 'Antman2025!' remove uac 'ADAM.SILVER' -f ACCOUNTDISABLE

[-] ['ACCOUNTDISABLE'] property flags removed from ADAM.SILVER's userAccountControl
```

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With the account re-enabled and armed with valid credentials, we initiated a session using<code>evil-winrm</code><span class="codefix">,</span> a reliable tool for remote PowerShell access in Windows environments. Connecting to the domain controller as <span class="blue">adam.silver</span>, we navigated to the user‚Äôs<code>Desktop</code> and retrieved the<code>user.txt</code> flag ‚Äî final confirmation that our foothold had been successfully established.
</p>

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Privilege Escalation

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With initial access established through<code>evil-winrm</code> as <span class="blue">adam.silver</span>, our focus shifted to enumeration for potential privilege escalation. Listing the contents of the root directory (<code>C:\</code>), a<code>Backups</code> folder stood out. Navigating into it revealed a single archive:<code>site-backup-2024-12-30.zip</code><span class="codefix">.</span> Using<code>evil-winrm</code>'s<code>download</code> functionality, we retrieved the file locally for further inspection, a promising lead for credential reuse or sensitive configuration leakage.

### üìÇ Extracting Credentials via DPAPI

<p class="indent-paragraph">
Using the credentials extracted from the backup, we authenticated to the domain controller via<code>evil-winrm</code> as<code>steph.cooper</code><span class="codefix">.</span> Upon accessing the user's<code>Documents</code> folder, we identified a file named<code>masterkey</code><span class="codefix">.</span> This file is likely related to the Data Protection API (DPAPI) and may contain encrypted keys used to protect other credentials stored on the system. Recognizing its forensic value, we promptly downloaded it for local analysis. Such artifacts are pivotal in later stages when attempting to decrypt password blobs or secure system data.

### üõ°Ô∏è Domain Replication Attack with DRSUAPI

It is worth noting that such credentials can be silently stored by the system when a privileged account is used via the Windows UAC prompt or through<code>runas /savecred</code><span class="codefix">.</span> In these scenarios, domain administrator credentials may be cached and protected with DPAPI under the standard user‚Äôs context. In this case, after extracting and decrypting the DPAPI blobs, we retrieved the plaintext credentials for<code>steph.cooper_adm</code><span class="codefix">.</span> To confirm the privilege level, we authenticated against the domain controller using<code>nxc</code><span class="codefix">,</span> and the<code>(Pwn3d!)</code> indicator verified that the account holds Domain Admin privileges‚Äîvalidating a complete domain compromise.

<p class="indent-paragraph">
With valid domain administrator credentials in hand, the next logical step was to extract the NTDS.dit secrets from the domain controller. This was performed using<code>crackmapexec</code> with the<code>--ntds</code> flag, which allowed for a full dump of user password hashes from Active Directory. It is important to highlight that although tools like<code>netexec</code> (nxc) support similar functionality, attempting an NTDS dump using<code>nxc --ntds</code> on recent Windows Server builds (such as 2019 or 2022) may crash the domain controller. As such,<code>crackmapexec</code> remains the safer and more stable option for this task.

With full domain administrator privileges established, we had direct access to all user directories on the system. From this point, two viable paths could be followed to retrieve the<code>root.txt</code> flag. The first involved navigating to<code>C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop</code> using the<code>steph.cooper_adm</code> account, which had sufficient rights to enumerate and read contents from other user folders. Alternatively, we leveraged the Administrator account's NT hash, previously extracted via<code>crackmapexec</code><span class="codefix">,</span> to authenticate using Pass-the-Hash through<code>evil-winrm</code><span class="codefix">,</span> bypassing the need for the cleartext password entirely.

This final technique showcases a critical risk in Active Directory environments where NTLM hashes, once exposed, can grant full access without triggering conventional authentication controls. Using the Administrator's hash, we established a new WinRM session and directly accessed the<code>root.txt</code> file, confirming total domain compromise.
